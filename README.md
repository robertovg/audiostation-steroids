# audiostation-steroids


This google chrome extension provides Synology DSM AudioStation extra-functionalities such as last.fm integration, shortcut access, etc.

# Service is now discontinued.

This repository contains only the source code of the frontend ( Chrome extension) of Audiostation steroids now but the server side of it has been now disconnected.

I recommend using any other of the many options available to scrobble your plays to last.fm. The source of the project ( both backend and frontend ) are available, so feel free to use it.
